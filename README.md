# Basic Blog Website (HTML & CSS)

This is the first website I built while learning web development — a simple static blog built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Live Demo

## Purpose

This was a **learning project** created to practice the core building blocks of web development:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Styling pages using CSS
- Creating layouts and text formatting
- Working with images and basic navigation

## What I Learned

- Structuring a webpage from scratch  
- Using classes and selectors in CSS  
- Creating a clean, readable layout without any frameworks  
- Basics of responsive layout (to a small extent)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  

## Notes

- There is **no JavaScript** in this project — it was focused purely on layout and styling.  
- Design is intentionally simple, with an emphasis on structure over visuals.

## Reflection

This was my first real step into frontend development. While it's not polished or complex, it helped me understand how websites are structured and styled — and gave me the confidence to start building bigger things.
